The focus is on systems using homogeneous processors, but the problems of parallel computing using heterogeneous processors are surveyed. Problems requiring high-performance parallel computation for their effective solution are introduced to justify the need for these systems. The taxonomy of parallel systems is presented, including a discussion of shared-memory and message-passing systems. The forms of parallelism and measures of performance for parallel systems are covered. Algorithm design for parallel systems is introduced, including many algorithms used in classic applications, conversion of serial algorithms to parallel algorithms, and design principles for new parallel algorithms. Languages suitable for expressing parallel algorithms are surveyed, including discussion of compiler techniques appropriate for detecting potential parallelism. A review of classic concurrent program synchronization techniques is provided as well as an introduction to additional synchronization techniques appropriate for parallel systems. Substantial student activity in actual implementation of parallel algorithms using machine-independent modern facilities like MPI is a part of the course.  Cross-listed with CSCI8446.",

                "desc": "This course is an introduction to computation using multiple processors, either as components of a single tightly-coupled system or as individual processors in a loosely-coupled system using a high-speed interconnection network. The focus is on systems using homogeneous processors, but the problems of parallel computing using heterogeneous processors are surveyed. Problems requiring high-performance parallel computation for their effective solution are introduced to justify the need for these systems. The taxonomy of parallel systems is presented, including a discussion of shared-memory and message-passing systems. The forms of parallelism and measures of performance for parallel systems are covered. Algorithm design for parallel systems is introduced, including many algorithms used in classic applications, conversion of serial algorithms to parallel algorithms, and design principles for new parallel algorithms. Languages suitable for expressing parallel algorithms are surveyed, including discussion of compiler techniques appropriate for detecting potential parallelism. A review of classic concurrent program synchronization techniques is provided as well as an introduction to additional synchronization techniques appropriate for parallel systems. Substantial student activity in actual implementation of parallel algorithms using machine-independent modern facilities like MPI is a part of the course.  Cross-listed with CSCI8446.",

The focus is on systems using homogeneous processors, but the problems of parallel computing using heterogeneous processors are surveyed. Problems requiring high-performance parallel computation for their effective solution are introduced to justify the need for these systems. The taxonomy of parallel systems is presented, including a discussion of shared-memory and message-passing systems. The forms of parallelism and measures of performance for parallel systems are covered. Algorithm design for parallel systems is introduced, including many algorithms used in classic applications, conversion of serial algorithms to parallel algorithms, and design principles for new parallel algorithms. Languages suitable for expressing parallel algorithms are surveyed, including discussion of compiler techniques appropriate for detecting potential parallelism. A review of classic concurrent program synchronization techniques is provided as well as an introduction to additional synchronization techniques appropriate for parallel systems. Substantial student activity in actual implementation of parallel algorithms using machine-independent modern facilities like MPI is a part of the course.  Cross-listed with CSCI8446.",

The focus is on systems using homogeneous processors, but the problems of parallel computing using heterogeneous processors are surveyed. Problems requiring high-performance parallel computation for their effective solution are introduced to justify the need for these systems. The taxonomy of parallel systems is presented, including a discussion of shared-memory and message-passing systems. The forms of parallelism and measures of performance for parallel systems are covered. Algorithm design for parallel systems is introduced, including many algorithms used in classic applications, conversion of serial algorithms to parallel algorithms, and design principles for new parallel algorithms. Languages suitable for expressing parallel algorithms are surveyed, including discussion of compiler techniques appropriate for detecting potential parallelism. A review of classic concurrent program synchronization techniques is provided as well as an introduction to additional synchronization techniques appropriate for parallel systems. Substantial student activity in actual implementation of parallel algorithms using machine-independent modern facilities like MPI is a part of the course.  Cross-listed with CSCI8446.",

The focus is on systems using homogeneous processors, but the problems of parallel computing using heterogeneous processors are surveyed. Problems requiring high-performance parallel computation for their effective solution are introduced to justify the need for these systems. The taxonomy of parallel systems is presented, including a discussion of shared-memory and message-passing systems. The forms of parallelism and measures of performance for parallel systems are covered. Algorithm design for parallel systems is introduced, including many algorithms used in classic applications, conversion of serial algorithms to parallel algorithms, and design principles for new parallel algorithms. Languages suitable for expressing parallel algorithms are surveyed, including discussion of compiler techniques appropriate for detecting potential parallelism. A review of classic concurrent program synchronization techniques is provided as well as an introduction to additional synchronization techniques appropriate for parallel systems. Substantial student activity in actual implementation of parallel algorithms using machine-independent modern facilities like MPI is a part of the course.  Cross-listed with CSCI8446.",

Through the construction and analysis of block-based visual artifacts (e.g., pixel art and geometric patterns), this course aims to help students learn the essential thought processes used by computer scientists to solve problems, expressing those solutions as computer programs. When executed, these computer programs produce visual artifacts that can be displayed and interacted with using a variety of tools/software including LEGO Digital Designer, Minecraft, LDraw, 3D Builder, and Virtual Reality systems such as the HTC Vive.",

The coverage of Python language features are aimed mainly at the data analytics studies of this course. The second part of the course emphasizes applying Python and its rich functional libraries and special software packages to data munging, analysis, mining, and visualization, and machine learning techniques including statistical analysis, parameter estimation, regression, classification, predictive modeling construction, etc.",

Topics include: an introduction to digital forensics, data acquisition, first response, memory forensics, operating system forensics, and network forensics. Students will be required to perform several forensics analyses in a controlled lab environment, including acquiring forensically sound hard drive images, memory images and analyzing these using industry standard tools, such as Forensic Toolkit (FTK).  The Digital Forensics class is designed for Cybersecurity, Computer Science and other qualified students to learn what actions are both appropriate and required for preserving, collecting and analyzing digital evidence in cases of intrusion, data theft or other cybercrimes.

When executed, these computer programs produce visual artifacts that can be displayed and interacted with using a variety of tools/software including LEGO Digital Designer, Minecraft, LDraw, 3D Builder, and Virtual Reality systems such as the HTC Vive.",
