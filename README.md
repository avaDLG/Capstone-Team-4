1. Introduction:

 This is an application to predict Computer Science class sizes for the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Every semester the CS administration must manually look at data from previous semesters to set the number of student spots avaliable for the upcoming semester. 
 
 To run the application locally run the app.py file and head http://127.0.0.1:5000/ You can see the UNO logo and the sign-in options. 
 
 Unchanged: http://127.0.0.1:5000/filter/CIST1400 use filter and the class code and number to be able to search for all data (past and predicted) for that specific class. 

2. Release Notes:
 
 The application is a currently an application of back-end linear regression modeling, a Flask API to connect to the the front end HTML and CSS screens. 


The sign-in is almost working perfectly. Password hashing and user registration is correct and tested. Authentication is still in the works currently.

We will continue to refine our linear models, test with the Cloud DB, and figure out a way to display mat.plot.lib graphs on the user screens. 
   
3. Branches

The Main branch has all of the work that we have pushed that does run sucessfully. The other branches we have are to keep developing the front and backend without interfereing with the basic model and interface we have now. T
